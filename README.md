How to Run:
Save as screen_flicker.bat in the Kali VM.

Transfer to a Windows machine (e.g., via SCP or USB).

Double-click to run on Windows, or execute via command prompt: screen_flicker.bat.

Effect: The script simulates screen flickering by sending brightness adjustment keys (F6, though actual keys may vary by system) via a temporary VBS script. The random delay keeps the user on edge. Note: Effectiveness depends on the Windows systemâ€™s brightness key bindings.

Purpose: Causes the Windows screen to flicker by rapidly toggling the brightness (simulated via overlay), annoying the user.
Why Batchfile?: Batch scripts are effective for Windows-specific system manipulations, and this can be scripted in the Kali VM for a Windows target.
